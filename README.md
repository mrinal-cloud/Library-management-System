# Library-management-System
This is a web-based library management system that allows you to manage your library's collections, members, and borrowing and returning of books.


Working on a team project that focuses on the areas: data-base, user interface (UI), and user experience (UX).
– In addition to the database, we are also responsible for creating the user interface (UI) and ensuring a positive user
experience (UX) for the application’s users. This involves designing an intuitive and visually appealing interface
that allows users to easily access and manipulate the data stored in the database.
